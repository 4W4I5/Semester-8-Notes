# Lecture 3: Ethical Theories
## **1. Introduction to Ethical Theories**

- Ethical theories help determine whether actions are right or wrong.
- Used to develop **codes of ethics** and guide **decision-making**.
- Different societies have developed and debated these theories over time.

## **2. Consequentialism**

- Judges actions **based on their outcomes**.
- **Harm minimization** → Less harm = more ethical decision.
- **Types:**
	1. **Egoism** – Maximizes individual benefit.
		- “Good for me, least harm to me.”
		- Self-centered approach, prioritizes personal gain.
	2. **Utilitarianism** – Maximizes benefit for the majority.
		- “Good for the group, least harm for the group.”
		- Decision-making focuses on overall happiness.
	3. **Altruism** – Prioritizes others over oneself.
		- “Good for all, some harm to me.”
		- Self-sacrificing actions for the benefit of others.

### **Altruism vs. Compassion**

- **Compassion**: Feeling motivated to help others.
- **Altruism**: Acting on that compassion **without expecting personal gain**.

## **3. Deontological Ethics**

- Judges actions based on **intentions**, not outcomes.
- **Deon (Greek)** = **Duty** → Ethics is based on moral obligations.
- **Example:** Killing is wrong, but if done in self-defense, it is ethical because the **intent was to protect**.
- Actions are **intrinsically right or wrong**, regardless of consequences.

## **4. Human Nature Ethics (Aristotelian Ethics)**

- **Human beings are capable of achieving happiness** through their natural faculties.
- Actions are **judged based on their contribution to personal growth** and fulfillment.
- **Evil actions stem from lacking essential capabilities** (ignorance, lack of virtue).

## **5. Relativism**

- **Denies universal moral norms** – morality depends on culture, society, or individuals.
- Ethics are **not fixed in time** and evolve with society.
- **Example:** Something considered wrong today may be accepted in the future.

## **6. Hedonism**

- **Pleasure and happiness are the highest good**.
- **Maximizing pleasure, minimizing pain** is the basis of morality.
- **Example:** A hedonist pursues enjoyable experiences while avoiding suffering.

## **7. Emotivism**

- **Moral statements are expressions of emotion, not objective truths**.
- **Example:** Saying “Stealing is wrong” is an expression of disapproval, not a factual claim.
- **Key Ideas:**
	- Moral judgments are **subjective** and based on emotions.
	- Used to **persuade** others rather than express facts.
	- **No objective moral truth exists.**

## **8. Ethical Decision-Making**

- **Factors to consider:**
	- Who is affected?
	- What are their rights?
	- What are the risks and benefits?
	- What actions are possible?
	- What is the most ethical choice?
