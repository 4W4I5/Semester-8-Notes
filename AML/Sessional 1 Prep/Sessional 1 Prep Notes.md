# Lecture 1: Introduction
## **Key Terms & Concepts**
- ### **Cybersecurity**
	- Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and attacks. It includes multiple domains:
		- **Network Security** – Protecting data in transit from interception or tampering.
		- **Application Security** – Ensuring software is secure from vulnerabilities.
		- **Information Security** – Safeguarding data from breaches and leaks.
		- **Operational Security** – Managing access controls and monitoring user activity.
	- Common **cyber threats** include:
		- **Malware** – Malicious software like viruses, worms, and trojans.
		- **Phishing** – Social engineering attacks that trick users into revealing credentials.
		- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** – Overloading a network to disrupt services.
		- **MitM (Man-in-the-Middle)** – Intercepting communication between two parties.
- ### **Dataset**
	- A dataset is a structured collection of related data points used for analysis, research, or decision-making. In cybersecurity, datasets contain logs, network traffic, or malware samples used for training ML models.
	- Types of datasets:
		- **Structured** – Organized in rows/columns (e.g., SQL databases).
		- **Unstructured** – Text, images, and logs that require preprocessing.
		- **Labeled** – Contain both input and output labels for supervised learning.
		- **Unlabeled** – Only raw input data, used in unsupervised learning.
- ### **Big Data**
	- Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that require specialized tools to process. It is defined by the **5 V’s**:
		1. **Volume** – Massive amounts of data generated.
		2. **Velocity** – The speed at which data is collected and processed.
		3. **Variety** – Different data formats (structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
		4. **Veracity** – Ensuring data quality and accuracy.
		5. **Value** – Extracting meaningful insights from raw data.
	- Big Data is crucial for cybersecurity, as it enables large-scale threat detection, anomaly detection, and fraud prevention.
- ### **Data Analytics**
	- Data analytics is the process of extracting useful insights from raw data. It involves multiple phases:
		1. **Identify** – Define the problem or goal.
		2. **Data Collection** – Gather relevant data from various sources.
		3. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, filter, and normalize data.
		4. **Data Exploration** – Analyze patterns and trends in the data.
		5. **Data Transformation** – Convert data into a usable format.
		6. **Data Modeling** – Apply ML algorithms for predictions or classifications.
		7. **Data Interpretation** – Understand the results and extract insights.
		8. **Data Visualization** – Present findings in charts, graphs, or reports.
		9. **Reporting & Decision-Making** – Use insights to make informed security decisions.
